    in any way that you want but it must perform a valid reduction for the two
    science frames in the dataset using the functions that you have implemented in
    this module. Then perform aperture photometry on at least one of the science
    frames, using apertures and sky annuli that make sense for the data. The function
    must accept the data_dir as an argument, which is the path to the directory with
    the raw data.

    No specific output is required but make sure the function prints/saves all the
    relevant information to the screen or to a file, and that any plots are saved to
    PNG or PDF files.
