    - Accept a list of aperture radii as a list of floats.
    - Accept a the radius at which to measure the sky background as sky_radius_in.
    - Accept a the width of the annulus as sky_annulus_width.
    - For each position and radius, calculate the flux in the aperture, subtracting
      the sky background. You can do this any way that you like but probably you'll
      want to use SkyCircularAnnulus from photutils.
    - The function should return the results from the aperture photometry. Usually
      this will be an astropy table from calling photutils aperture_photometry, but
      it can be something different if you use a different library.

    Note that the automated tests just check that you are returning from this
    function, but they do not check the contents of the returned data.
